# Titanic Dataset EDA – Syntecxhub Internship Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Titanic-like dataset to understand patterns in passenger survival.

##  Project Tasks
- Load dataset and inspect variables
- Create age buckets (Child, Adult, Senior)
- Analyze survival by:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class
  - Age Bucket
- Generate visualizations:
  - Bar charts
  - Histogram
  - Boxplot
  - Violin plot
- Export plots to PNG

##  Repository Structure

##  Insights
- Females survived more than males.
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rates.
- Children had better chances of survival.
- Seniors showed the lowest survival probability.
- Age distribution shows majority were adults.

##  Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib

##  How to Run
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
python titanic_eda.py
